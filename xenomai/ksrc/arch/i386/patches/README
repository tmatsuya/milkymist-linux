-- arch/i386/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

On the x86 architecture, Xenomai is supported on both the v2.4 and
v2.6 Linux kernel series, for which the appropriate Adeos patches
exist. Just apply one of those patches against the corresponding
kernel release. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL
guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.
